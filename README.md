# Incremental tasks

This repository contains the code to generate the incremental task dataset used
in [[1]](#ref).

## Interactive task solving

A user can try the tasks by himself by running `generate_tasks_cli`. This will
start an interactive session that will show random examples from the tasks of
the benchmarks, starting from the easiest.

Once a task is solved, it switches to a new one.

## Task generation



## Library

This package can be used as a library. Just install it from PyPI

```bash
pip install incremental_tasks
```
